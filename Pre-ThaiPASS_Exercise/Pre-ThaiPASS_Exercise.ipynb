    "In the ThaiPASS 2025 summer school, we will spend some time learning about the Sun and how scientists study it. We’ll use a Python package called SunPy to download and look at real data from space telescopes like NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the GOES satellites. Later, we’ll even compare the Sun with other stars using data from the TESS mission. This first exercise is just a practice run: making sure you have the right software installed and giving you some hands-on experience with downloading and exploring solar data in Python."
